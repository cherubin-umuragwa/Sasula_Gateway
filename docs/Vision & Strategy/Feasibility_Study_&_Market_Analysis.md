# Feasibility Study & Market Analysis

> Summary: Preliminary assessment of technical, operational, and market feasibility for Sasula Gateway. Links: [Vision](./Software_Vision_Document.md), [PRD](./Product_Requirements_Document_(PRD).md).

## Technical Feasibility
- Uses widely adopted tooling: Solidity, Hardhat, Next.js, Wagmi, Viem.
- Deploys to Base Sepolia for low-cost experimentation; path to Base mainnet.
- Contracts are small and auditable; test suite present.

## Operational Feasibility
- Vercel deploy for frontend; Hardhat for contracts.
- Simple environment variables; auto-update addresses via deploy script.

## Market Feasibility (high-level)
- Remittances and community finance are large addressable markets.
- On‑chain rails reduce cost and increase transparency.
- Competitive apps exist; differentiation via emergency-mode, ROSCA, reputation.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Smart contract risk → audits, coverage, bug bounties.
- UX complexity → wallet education, clear UI flows.
- Regulatory uncertainty → privacy controls, legal review (see Security & Legal).

## Next Steps
- Validate UX with pilot users.
- Incrementally harden contracts and add monitoring.
- Explore compliant mainnet rollout.
